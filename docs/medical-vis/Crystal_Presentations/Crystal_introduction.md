### Introduction

:::

Crystal features a powerful built-in rendering engine that supports rendering various data types, including but not limited to mesh data, volumetric data, point clouds, Gaussian kernels, and implicit neural field data. It offers multiple rendering modes such as volumetric path tracing, mesh-volume hybrid rendering, neural radiance field rendering and point cloud rendering. A notable feature of the Crystal engine is its support for cinematic-quality rendering effects across various visualization modes.

    ```python
    import pystal as ctl
    ctl.load_data("scene.txt","datamapper.txt")
    ctl.set_spp(1024)
    ctl.rendering()
    ```
  Python support has been provided for the renderer, allowing the rendering functionality to be directly called from Python scripts, and enabling the direct import of rendering output arrays into Python programs!
