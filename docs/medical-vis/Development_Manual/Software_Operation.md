## launch the program

Upon launching crystal.exe, the following interface will be displayed:

Crystal includes several examples and datasets, which can be accessed and explored through the "Startup Examples" section of the interface. 

There are two types of examples: "Demo" and "Example." 

The "Demo" examples are located in the software's Resources directory and can be launched directly. 

The "Example" files, stored in the "CrystalAssets" directory, are created by the user to manage their own datasets. 

If the user does not need to manage their own datasets or prefers to do so independently, they may choose not to use the "Example" files. By default, the example programs in the toolbar launch the "Demo" examples. To switch to the "Example" files, users can select the first option under the "Examples" menu in the menu bar. 

If the user does not require the functionality of the "Example", they may disregard it. It is also possible to launch the scene directly from an XML or JSON file.
