To better predict realistic illuminations, a new deep learning model is designed to efficiently parse complex LDR panoramas and classify detected light sources. Finally, realistic illumination intensities are calculated by recovering the inverse camera response function and extending the dynamic range of pixel values based on previously estimated parameters of light sources.
